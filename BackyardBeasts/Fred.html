				It was <span id="very">very</span> important for him that I create a webpage to vouch for his claim that he found all these crazy animals in his backyard. While he is extremely weird, all of his claims are <strong>true</strong>. I've had a few <a href="index.html#fluff_bandit">Fluff Bandits</a> eat all of the birdseed from my feeders before... very annoying.<br><br>
				Anyways, you can go back to Jeb's page <a href="index.html">here.</a>
